# 🚖 Uber Fare Prediction with XGBoost & OSMnx

This project focuses on **Uber Inc.**, the world's largest taxi company. The main goal is to **predict the fare amount** for future trips using **machine learning models**. By leveraging **real road distances from OSMnx** instead of Euclidean straight-line distances, the prediction model achieves **higher accuracy** and provides more realistic estimates.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset (sourced from **Kaggle**) contains the following fields:

- **key** → unique identifier for each trip  
- **fare_amount** → cost of each trip in USD  
- **pickup_datetime** → date and time when the meter was engaged  
- **passenger_count** → number of passengers in the vehicle (driver-entered)  
- **pickup_longitude** → longitude where the meter was engaged  
- **pickup_latitude** → latitude where the meter was engaged  
- **dropoff_longitude** → longitude where the meter was disengaged  
- **dropoff_latitude** → latitude where the meter was disengaged

## 🎯 Objective
1. Understand and clean the dataset (if required).  
2. Build **regression models** to predict Uber ride fares.  
3. Evaluate and compare models using **R², RMSE, and MAE**.

## 📈 Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 🧮 **MAE**  | 1.918 |
| 📏 **RMSE** | 3.679 |
| 📊 **R²**   | 0.831 |

✅ Since the dataset is synthetic, certain features may not be correlated, and therefore the accuracy is slightly affected.
